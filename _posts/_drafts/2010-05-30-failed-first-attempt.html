Well, for the first night of the sleep cycle correction experiment, I got into bed at 12:30 AM and joined the waking world at 12:30 PM. &nbsp;I did wake up before my alarm, (6:50 AM, alarm is at 7 AM) but I fell back asleep again and don't remember hearing the alarm so I don't think that counts.<br /><br />The one thing I was able to do successfully is not use a computer for an hour before bed. &nbsp;So, I guess that makes me 1 for 3.<br /><br />Tonight I know I won't be able to make the 11 PM bedtime deadline due to a code deployment that has to go through starting at the same time. &nbsp;For the same reason, I won't meet the "no computer before bed" goal either. &nbsp;Here's hoping I can at least make the wake up before alarm goal.<br /><br />(Reminder: The goal of the experiment is to discover a bedtime that allows me to fall asleep easily and wake up before my alarm goes off at 7AM. &nbsp;Such a time is considered discovered if I can maintain it for a week.)
