I spent some time fiddling around with a personal blog on tumblr (shawndrape.tumblr.com) but due to conflicts with another blog (which I may move over here as well) being labeled as the primary blog on their system it created come conflicts and issues that I just didn't want to deal with.<br /><br />To be completely honest, I had forgotten about this blog that I started <i>waaaay</i>&nbsp;back when. I don't have many thoughts here, but I think I can put up a couple more pretty quickly within the next few weeks. I have been having many long discussions with <a href="http://twitter.com/gojeffcho" target="_blank">@gojeffcho</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonpkaplan" target="_blank">@jasonpkaplan</a> on Twitter about the quality of recent Zelda games (namely, Skyward Sword) compared to the older ones. As a result, I'll have material for a review/opinion piece on Skyward Sword AND Ocarina of Time to share before too long.<br /><br />Otherwise, I'm just going to see where this goes. ;D
