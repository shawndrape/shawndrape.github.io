<br /><ul><li>In the past, communication has been bound to unique IDs (phone numbers, e-mail addresses)</li><li>A single person having several unique IDs bound to them causes communication schisms</li><ul><li>eg. Is this a home phone number, or a cell phone number? Is it work or personal?</li></ul><li>Prior to our digital "revolution", communication was&nbsp;inherently&nbsp;tied to identity</li><ul><li>eg. Physical addresses: A location and a name of someone that can be found there (was admittedly vague and&nbsp;unverifiable)</li><ul><li>thought experiment: Addresses with internet handles</li></ul></ul><li>Social networks allow us to tie together the unique IDs into a single identity, one which can be verified. Some are doing better than others</li><ul><li>Twitter: People generally have only one "personal" account, despite many activity/joke/themed accounts. Abstracts&nbsp;receiving&nbsp;end</li><li>Google+: Single contact, using chat or hangouts/messenger. Abstracts destination-ish</li><li>Apple: Hardware based, but abstracts destination. Single user (bound by phone #, but collated with Apple ID)</li><li>Facebook: Single account, abstracts destination. Makes all communication essentially the same.</li></ul><li>Forced with a meta-problem: Which social network do we use to communicate? It's the "which number to call" all over again</li><li>(Open) Solution needed which allows people to specify priority of contact, which all methods of contact should expose</li></ul>
