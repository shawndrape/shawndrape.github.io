<b>Day 2</b><br /><b><br /></b><br />Day two would have been a success of my goals were it not for the deployment I had to do. &nbsp;I ended up starting the deployment a bit earlier than anticipated, and got it done by the time 11 PM rolled around. &nbsp;However, instead of trying to meet the "Sleep at 11PM" goal, I decided to meet the "No computer for an hour before bed" goal. &nbsp;So I stayed up until midnight reading a junk novel that I had picked up earlier this year since it was on sale and I was in the store for Objective-C books anyways. &nbsp;I woke up at the alarming time of 8:19 AM however, so I don't think the trade-off was a good one.<br /><br />Summary: 1/3 goals met, didn't regress.<br /><br /><b>Day 3</b><br /><b><br /></b><br />After coming back home early and getting caught in the rain I left early to avoid (btw, I think&nbsp;meteorologists&nbsp;use the term "thunder showers" way too liberally these days) I collapsed to watch TV and cook a small dinner before heading out to my gumdo session.<br /><br />Tangent: The martial art <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haidong_Gumdo">Haidong Gumdo</a>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;swordsmanship&nbsp;martial art from Korea that I picked up during my first year of university. As a martial art, I find that it puts more emphasis on fluidity of motion and the sound of a sword whistling through the air as you dance around opponents is breathtaking. &nbsp;Anyone interested should take a look <a href="http://eng.hdgd.org/">here</a>&nbsp;and find out if there is a practicing dojang near them.<br /><br />Because of the session running from 9 PM to 10 PM, I didn't get home until about 10:30 and was restless up until 11 PM. &nbsp;However, I did manage to get to bed at 11! =D<br /><br />Unfortunately, I still didn't wake up on my own before my alarm, so I was unable to meet all three goals.<br /><br />Summary: 2/3 goals met<br /><br /><b>Addendum</b><br /><b><br /></b><br />Since I was able to get to bed by 11 PM but still didn't get up before the alarm, I will be moving the target bedtime up by 15 minutes to 10:45 PM. &nbsp;Each night I am able to get to bed by the target time but can't wake up before the alarm, I move up the bedtime. &nbsp;This is so that I can get an idea of when my ideal sleep cycle should begin and end. &nbsp;Here's hoping I don't have to move it up too far!
