rant style<br /><br />talking points<br /><br /><ul><li>Tools to build are free, meaning always going to be tied to iPad and Apple products</li><li>Not targeting educators and school boards, but students; a double edged sword</li><ul><li>targeting students allows education revolution, students control access to information</li><li>economic burden on families means just for the afluent middle class</li><li>if entire classroom not on iPads, what good is it?</li><ul><li>todo: research of textbook makers are making page # parallels between ebooks and physical books</li></ul><li>modern day classrooms not ready for a student centric shift (a la khanacademy)</li></ul><li>targets high school over university, where students are more bound by textbook cost and are free to find their own versions of books</li><ul><li>real goal: get high school students used to ebooks on iPad, university level forced to react</li><ul><li>admit: actually very smart since at university level textbook owners are not going to opt-in to lowering costs and constant payments. They must be forced</li></ul></ul><li>Summary: Apple's announcement meant to look like doing good for education, but is really all about tying education to Apple hardware and software</li></ul>
